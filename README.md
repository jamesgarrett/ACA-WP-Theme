# ACA WP Docs

This is the documentation for ACA’s base Wordpress theme.

## General

For the most part this theme is built entirely on native Wordpress functionality. The exception is two plugins – *[Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)* and *[WP Blade](https://github.com/MikaelMattsson/blade)* – which augment Wordpress’ default functionality and on which we rely heavily. The former is used to extend and customize the Wordpress backend.

### WP Blade

WP Blade is a port of [Laravel's](http://laravel.com/) templating engine wrapped up in a Wordpress plugin. Blade extends PHP’s default capabilities with useful templating concepts like extensible layouts and quicker syntax for basic control structures. It essentially supercharges Wordpress’ default [template functions])

- Layouts
- Partials
- Quick Echo
- Simplified Syntax
- WP Query control (specific to *WP Blade.*)
- Loop control (specific to *WP Blade.*)

#### Layouts

As you’d expect layouts live in the [`layouts`](tree/master/layouts)  directory.

##### Default Sections
- Notify
- Main
- Side
- Breakout
